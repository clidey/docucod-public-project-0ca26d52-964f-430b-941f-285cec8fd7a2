# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide addresses frequent issues encountered when using the **dAppServer/wails-build-action** GitHub Action. Whether facing version mismatches, missing secrets, platform-specific errors, or workflow misconfigurations, these actionable solutions will help you get your Wails.io desktop app builds running smoothly.

---

## 1. Version Compatibility Problems

### Issue: Incompatible Go, Node, or Wails Versions

- **Symptom:** Builds fail with errors referencing Go, Node.js, or Wails version incompatibilities.

- **Solution:**
  1. Explicitly set the action input versions in your workflow YAML:

  ```yaml
  with:
    go-version: "1.23"
    node-version: "18.x"
    wails-version: "v2.9.0"  # Avoid v2.10.0 due to known issues
  ```

  2. Pin versions to stable releases known to work (e.g., `v2.9.0` for Wails, Go `1.23`, Node `18.x`).
  3. Check the README and release notes for any known version-specific problems.

### Pro Tip:
> Always use the `latest` tag cautiously. For production workflows, lock versions to avoid unexpected breaking changes.

## 2. Missing or Incorrect Secrets for Code Signing

### Issue: Code signing fails on macOS or Windows during signing steps.

- **Symptom:** The action logs errors about missing certificates or authentication failures.

- **Solution:**
  1. Ensure all signing related secrets are correctly created in GitHub Secrets with exact key names expected by the action.
  2. Validate that the secrets have the correct base64-encoded certificates, passwords, and identifiers:

    - For macOS: `sign-macos-app-cert`, `sign-macos-app-cert-password`, `sign-macos-installer-cert`, `sign-macos-installer-cert-password`, `sign-macos-apple-password`, `sign-macos-app-id`, and `sign-macos-installer-id`.
    - For Windows: `sign-windows-cert` and `sign-windows-cert-password`.

  3. Confirm your workflow conditionally triggers signing only on tagged releases, e.g.,:

  ```yaml
  if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
  ```

  4. Verify certificates are valid and properly imported before signing (refer to [Code Signing Setup Guide](getting-started/install-configure/code-signing-setup)).

### Common Pitfall:
> Forgetting to base64 encode certificates or mislabeling secrets leads to cryptic signing errors.

## 3. Platform-Specific Dependency or Build Failures

### Linux Dependency Issues

- **Symptom:** Build fails on Linux runners with missing libraries such as GTK or WebKit.

- **Solution:**
  - The action automatically installs dependencies for supported Ubuntu versions (20.04, 22.04, 24.04).
  - If your runner uses a different Linux distro or version, add manual installation steps or switch to supported runners.

### macOS Build or Permission Errors

- **Symptom:** Executable permissions missing, or installers fail silently.

- **Solution:**
  - The action automatically runs `chmod +x` on built binaries.
  - Ensure your workflow does not override or skip these steps.
  - For silent errors during installer creation, check your signing certificates and environment variables.

### Windows Signing or Path Issues

- **Symptom:** Signing tools fail, or binaries not found due to path discrepancies.

- **Solution:**
  - Use Windows runners (e.g., `windows-latest`) with correct filesystem paths in your workflow.
  - Verify the signing certificate is decoded properly before signing.
  - Review the Windows SDK path hardcoded in the action and update if necessary.

## 4. Workflow YAML Misconfigurations

### Issue: Workflow fails early or skips essential steps

- **Symptom:** The build action doesnâ€™t run as expected, or important steps are skipped.

- **Solution:**
  1. Check input parameters for syntax correctness and required fields:

  ```yaml
  with:
    build-name: yourAppName   # Required
    build-platform: linux/amd64   # Valid platform string
  ```

  2. Avoid conflicting inputs such as setting `build` to `false` when expecting a build.
  3. Confirm conditional expressions in workflow steps are valid, e.g., ensure correct use of `if:` clauses.
  4. Use matrix strategies carefully to avoid unsupported OS-platform combos.

## 5. Common Error Messages and How to Resolve Them

| Error Message                               | Cause                                 | Recommended Fix                                    |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `Unsupported Linux distribution: <version>` | Using a non-supported Linux version | Switch to Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, or 24.04 runner or customize dependencies manually. |
| `Failed to find signing certificate`      | Missing or invalid signing secrets  | Verify and base64 encode certs, update secrets.  |
| `Command not found: wails`                  | Wails not installed or cached        | Ensure `wails` installs before build, enable cache or use `wails-dev-build: false`. |
| `Permission denied` during build steps    | Missing executable permissions       | Allow chmod step or ensure runner has correct permissions. |

## 6. Diagnostic Tips

- Review full workflow logs in GitHub Actions for detailed error traces.
- Validate environment variables and inputs from your workflow run logs.
- Enable verbose logging in your build commands if possible for more insights.
- When signing issues arise, test signing locally if feasible to isolate environment problems.

## 7. When to Escalate

If you have exhausted these troubleshooting steps and still encounter issues:

- Review [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dAppServer/wails-build-action/issues) for similar problems or to file a bug report.
- Provide logs, minimal reproducible workflows, and describe your runner environment.
- Check compatibility notes and recent changes impacting your build versions.
