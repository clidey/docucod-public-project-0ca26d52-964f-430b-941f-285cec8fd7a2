# Validating Output & Artifacts

This guide explains how to access, verify, and validate the output artifacts generated by the `dAppServer/wails-build-action` GitHub Action after your builds complete. You will learn how to confirm the presence of platform-specific executables, check packaging results, test that your built application launches correctly, and perform basic troubleshooting on common install and runtime issues.

---

## 1. Accessing Workflow Artifacts

Once a workflow utilizing `dAppServer/wails-build-action` finishes, the build artifacts are uploaded automatically (when `package: true` is set, the default). Follow these steps to locate and download them:

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
2. Select the completed workflow run from the list.
3. Scroll down to the **Artifacts** section under the run summary.
4. Click the artifact named like `Wails Build <OS> <Build Name>`.
5. Download the ZIP or archive containing your build output.

The artifacts typically include:

- Platform-specific executables or `.app` bundles.
- Platform installer packages (NSIS for Windows, `.dmg` or `.pkg` for macOS).
- Supporting files such as `.zip` bundles of the app for macOS.

<Tip>
Always verify you are downloading the artifact from the correct workflow run, especially if multiple builds execute concurrently on different platforms.
</Tip>

## 2. Identifying Executables for Each Platform

The output structure varies by platform:

| Platform | Typical Artifacts                                 | File Extensions / Format            |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Windows  | Executable binary and installer                  | `.exe` (e.g., `wailsApp.exe`), NSIS installer (`wailsApp-amd64-installer.exe`) |
| macOS    | `.app` bundle, signed `.pkg` installer, zipped `.app` archive |
| Linux    | Executable binary                                | No extension, executable file     |

Check the artifacts folder inside the archive for a `bin` subfolder, which contains these outputs.

<Check>
If your build is multi-platform, verify that the artifact for each targeted platform appears separately under respective workflow matrix jobs.
</Check>

## 3. Confirming Packaging and Signing

Your workflow can be configured to package the builds into installers or archives, and optionally sign them (via the `sign` input).

- **Windows:** Verify presence of the NSIS installer if `nsis` is enabled.
- **macOS:** Verify:
  - `.app` bundle exists.
  - `.pkg` installer exists if signing and packaging enabled.
  - `.app.zip` archive is generated.
- **Linux:** Typically just the executable; no installer packaging included.

<Tip>
If signing is enabled, confirm the signed artifacts by checking their digital signatures before distribution. Unsigned executables might trigger security warnings on some systems.
</Tip>

## 4. Testing the Built Application Launch

After downloading and extracting the relevant build artifact:

1. **Windows:**
   - Run the `.exe` file directly or install via the NSIS installer.
2. **macOS:**
   - Double-click the `.app` bundle or `.pkg` installer to install and launch.
3. **Linux:**
   - Ensure the executable has execute permissions (`chmod +x <binary>`).
   - Run it from terminal.

On launch, your app should open with the configured window size and background color, reflecting your Wails project setup.

<Warning>
If the app fails to start, check console or terminal logs for errors — missing dependencies or incorrect permissions are common causes.
</Warning>

## 5. Basic Troubleshooting for Install/Run Errors

Here are common issues and how to resolve them:

| Issue                       | Cause                                                | Solution                                                  |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Application won't launch    | Missing execute permissions (Linux/macOS)            | Run `chmod +x` on executable files.                       |
| Installer fails silently    | Missing code signing credentials (macOS/Windows)     | Verify your signing inputs and secret keys are correct.   |
| Unexpected window size/color| Configuration mismatch in Wails project or build     | Confirm your `wails.json` and frontend builds are up-to-date and matching the build inputs.
| Artifacts missing or corrupt| Workflow packaging skipped, or upload failed          | Check your workflow logs and the `package` input setting.

<Note>
Be sure to consult your GitHub Actions workflow logs — they provide detailed output of each build and packaging step, including errors if any.
</Note>

## 6. Best Practices for Verification

- **Automate smoke tests** on your built binaries within CI if possible.
- **Validate code signatures** on signed macOS or Windows packages before distribution.
- **Compare checksum hashes** (e.g., SHA256) of artifacts to ensure integrity during transfer.
- **Use explicit artifact naming** in your workflow to avoid confusion between platform builds.

## 7. Next Steps

Once you've validated your output and artifacts:

- Proceed to setting up **Code Signing** for enhanced distribution security (see [Setting Up Code Signing (MacOS & Windows)](/getting-started/install-configure/code-signing-setup)).
- Explore further **Build Options Configuration** to customize builds (see [Configuring Build Options](/getting-started/install-configure/build-options-configuration)).
- If encountering issues, refer to [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/first-run-validation/common-setup-issues).
