# Adding the Action to GitHub Workflows

This guide walks you through integrating the `dAppServer/wails-build-action` into your GitHub Actions workflows. You'll learn how to configure the action with default settings, customize build parameters, and apply best practices for signing, packaging, and multi-platform automation.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before adding the action to your workflow:

- Ensure your repository is prepared according to the [Preparing Your Repository](../setup-overview/preparing-your-repository) guide.
- Confirm system dependencies and environment versions meet the [System Requirements](../setup-overview/system-requirements) guide.
- Have your code signing certificates ready for macOS and Windows if you plan to sign your builds.


## 2. Basic Integration: Default Build

The simplest way to get started is to add the action with minimal settings. At a minimum, you must specify the `build-name` and `build-platform` inputs.

```yaml
- uses: dAppServer/wails-build-action@main
  with:
    build-name: wailsApp
    build-platform: linux/amd64
```

This snippet configures the action to build your Wails app binary on a Linux amd64 platform.


## 3. Customizing Your Workflow

### A. Using Strategy Matrix for Multi-Platform Builds

You can automate builds across multiple OSes and platforms using GitHub's matrix strategy. Example:

```yaml
name: Wails build

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        build: [
          {name: wailsTest, platform: linux/amd64, os: ubuntu-latest},
          {name: wailsTest, platform: windows/amd64, os: windows-latest},
          {name: wailsTest, platform: darwin/universal, os: macos-latest}
        ]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.build.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          submodules: recursive
      - uses: dAppServer/wails-build-action@main
        with:
          build-name: ${{ matrix.build.name }}
          build-platform: ${{ matrix.build.platform }}
          build-obfuscate: true
```

This setup compiles the app across Linux, Windows, and macOS with obfuscation enabled.


### B. Controlling Upload and Packaging

To turn off artifact uploads and release creation, set `package: false`:

```yaml
- uses: dAppServer/wails-build-action@main
  with:
    build-name: wailsApp
    build-platform: linux/amd64
    package: false
```


### C. Important `with` Inputs

| Input                         | Required | Default        | Description                                                  |
|------------------------------|----------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `build-name`                 | Yes      | none           | Name of the output binary                                    |
| `build-platform`             | No       | darwin/universal | Target platform for build (e.g., linux/amd64, windows/amd64) |
| `build-obfuscate`            | No       | false          | Enable binary obfuscation                                    |
| `sign`                      | No       | false          | Enable code signing after build                              |
| `package`                   | No       | true           | Upload artifacts & create GitHub release on tagged builds   |
| `nsis`                      | No       | false          | Build Windows installer using NSIS                           |
| `wails-version`            | No       | latest         | Specific Wails version to install                            |
| `go-version`                | No       | 1.23           | Version of Go to use                                         |
| `node-version`              | No       | 18.x           | Node.js version for frontend build                          |
| ...                        |          |                | See full list in [action.yml](../../action.yml)             |


## 4. MacOS Code Signing Example

When signing on macOS, provide the required certificates and passwords as secrets. Example snippet:

```yaml
- uses: dAppServer/wails-build-action@main
  with:
    build-name: wailsApp
    build-platform: darwin/universal
    sign: true
    sign-macos-apple-password: ${{ secrets.APPLE_PASSWORD }}
    sign-macos-app-id: ${{ secrets.MACOS_DEVELOPER_CERT_ID }}
    sign-macos-app-cert: ${{ secrets.MACOS_DEVELOPER_CERT }}
    sign-macos-app-cert-password: ${{ secrets.MACOS_DEVELOPER_CERT_PASSWORD }}
    sign-macos-installer-id: ${{ secrets.MACOS_INSTALLER_CERT_ID }}
    sign-macos-installer-cert: ${{ secrets.MACOS_INSTALLER_CERT }}
    sign-macos-installer-cert-password: ${{ secrets.MACOS_INSTALLER_CERT_PASSWORD }}
```

Make sure to create appropriate `gon-sign.json` and `gon-notarize.json` files as per the [Code Signing Setup](../install-configure/code-signing-setup) guide.


## 5. Best Practices & Usage Tips

- **Use version pinning**: Specify exact `wails-version`, `go-version`, and `node-version` values for repeatable builds.
- **Cache dependencies**: Enable caching (`build-cache: true`) to speed up builds.
- **Leverage matrix builds** for comprehensive platform coverage without duplicating workflow code.
- **Set `package` to false** during debugging to avoid cluttering your releases with test artifacts.
- **Ensure code signing secrets** are securely stored in GitHub Secrets.


## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Fails Due to Unsupported Linux Distro

The action supports Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, and 24.04. If you receive errors related to missing dependencies:

- Confirm the runner uses a supported distro.
- Update or change your runner image accordingly.

### Signing Step Skipped Unexpectedly

- Signing only triggers on tagged commits (`refs/tags/*`). Make sure your push is tagged.
- Confirm that signing inputs and certificates are properly configured.

### Artifacts Not Uploading

- Verify `package` input is set to `true`.
- Check workflow logs for upload errors.


## 7. Complete Example Workflow

```yaml
name: Build and Release Wails App

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          submodules: recursive

      - uses: dAppServer/wails-build-action@main
        with:
          build-name: wailsApp
          build-platform: linux/amd64
          build-obfuscate: true
          sign: false
          package: true
          wails-version: "v2.9.0"
          go-version: "1.23"
          node-version: "18.x"
```

## 8. Next Steps

- After integrating the action, proceed to [Configuring Build Options](../build-options-configuration) for detailed control.
- Review [Setting Up Code Signing](../install-configure/code-signing-setup) if you plan to create signed apps.
- Run your first build following [Running Your First Build](../../first-run-validation/running-your-first-build).
