# Target Audience & Use Cases

## Empowering Developers and CI/CD Engineers

The **dAppServer/wails-build-action** is expertly designed for developers, DevOps professionals, and CI/CD engineers who build, package, sign, and distribute desktop applications using [Wails.io](https://wails.io) across multiple platforms including macOS, Windows, and Linux.

This GitHub Action streamlines complex build environments and repetitive tasks, enabling cross-platform Wails app releases to be automated with minimal effort and maximum reliability.

---

## Who Benefits Most?

- **Desktop App Developers using Wails.io:** Automate builds and packaging for macOS, Windows, and Linux versions of your app without maintaining separate scripts.

- **CI/CD Engineers & DevOps Teams:** Integrate a proven, configurable build action into your workflows to reliably produce signed, cross-platform binary releases.

- **Open Source and Enterprise Teams:** Accelerate release cycles with built-in caching, artifact management, and optional code-signing for secure and trusted delivery.

- **Cross-Platform Release Managers:** Simplify managing multiple build targets and distribution formats, including Windows installers and macOS signed packages.

## Real-World Use Cases 

### 1. Automated Cross-Platform Builds

Imagine you maintain a Wails app that needs to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Manually setting up build environments or maintaining VM images is error-prone and time-consuming.

By using this action, you configure your workflow once with minimal inputs like `build-name` and `build-platform`. The action handles installing Go, Node.js, and platform-specific dependencies, then compiles and packages your app for all target OSes automatically.

### 2. Artifact Packaging and Release Management

For projects that require distributing installers or zipped apps, this action automatically uploads build artifacts to GitHub releases. Upon tagging a release, the workflow pushes your compiled binaries, installers, and zipped app bundles.

This reduces manual intervention and makes it effortless to publish downloadable assets for your users.

### 3. Integrated Code Signing for macOS & Windows

Signing your applications boosts end-user trust and prevents OS warnings. This action supports importing code-signing certificates and automates the entire signing and notarization process for macOS apps and installers.

Similarly, on Windows, it can sign executables and installers with provided certificates, all handled seamlessly within your CI pipeline.

### 4. Build Customization & Security

Trusted teams can enhance their build security by obfuscating the Go code, enabling specified build tags, or embedding Webview2 components using configurable inputs without overhauling workflows.

This flexibility empowers teams to tailor builds to their environment and security policies.
